# Session 3 Assignment

**Goal:** Practice searching, filtering, and organizing references with search engines and Zotero. Keep track of your progress in your working journal.

**Tasks:**

* **Targeted Search & Initial Filtering:**
  * Using relevant academic search platforms, find at least **20 potentially relevant scholarly references** for your research topic. Eg. Google Scholar, JSTOR, etc.
  * Compare with AI platforms like Perplexity, Elicit, ResearchRabbit, etc.
  * Practice filtering these references based on titles, abstracts, keywords, and other basic metadata. **No in-depth reading is required at this stage.** The focus is on assessing potential relevance quickly.

* **Zotero Organization:**
  * Add all 20+ filtered references to your Zotero library. Ensure metadata is as complete and accurate as possible.
  * Organize these references in Zotero using features like tags and collections.
  * Be ready to explain how you searched for and filtered your 20 references.

* **Update & Track Progress:**
  * Update Design Document (e.g., `DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md`) as you search and collect references, e.g. refining/adding "keywords" or "fields" to your search.
  * Update your reserach journal (e.g., `RESEARCH_JOURNAL.md`) with your progress and reflections.
  * Commit your updated Design Document and Working Journal to your GitHub repository with a clear commit message.

**When you come to class:**

* Bring your GitHub repository link.
* Be prepared to share your Zotero library/organization approach.
* Be prepared to discuss your search/filtering strategy and your ideas about how to use the research journal.
